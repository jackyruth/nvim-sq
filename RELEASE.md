# nvim-sq 1.4

## Changes

- None

## New plugins

- [csvview.nvim](https://github.com/hat0uma/csvview.nvim)

## New key mappings

- `gr`->`gs` LSP \[g\]o to reference\[s\], since it conflicts with `gr`
  LSP-related key mappings starting with nvim 0.11. This functionality is now
  implemented by default starting with nvim 0.11 by the `grr` key mapping.
